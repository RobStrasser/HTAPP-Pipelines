This is a centralized space to decribe and point to computational pipelines used when analyzing the Human Tumor Atlas Pilot Project (HTAPP) data. [Please use the wiki attached to this repo to learn more](https://github.com/klarman-cell-observatory/HTAPP-Pipelines/wiki). Scripts used to analyze data from the [single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq toolbox for human tumors publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0844-1) can be found in the `HTAPP_methods_toolbox/` folder of this repository.

Thank you,
